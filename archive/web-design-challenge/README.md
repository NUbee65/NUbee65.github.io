# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Summary / Folder Contenxts

Per the assignment instructions, please find the repository the following items:

1. The 7 required HTML files: index, comparison, temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and data

2. An additional 8 HTML files named as Fig1-A, Fig 1-B, Fig 2-A... which provide full-size views of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere graphs

3. A Resources folder with four subfolders: assets, css, data, and js.  The assets folder contains an image folder.

4. A series of backup folders with dates in their folder-names that collectively show the evolution of my efforts.

## Thoughts

I think I generally accomplished the goals of this exercise.  I worked hard to emulate the look and feel of the core assignment.

For the bonus, I added my own data.  I added Northern and Southern Hemisphere graphs.  And I added my own analysis and discussion.

I tried very hard to make the Northern and Souther Hemisphere images modal, which involved a lot of work on the style.css and script.js files.  I could get the style and javascript code to work inside the html files.  But unfortunately, I haven't had enough experience with modal javascript files and modal style.css code and modal html code together to know exactly why I couldn't get everything to operate.

In any event, I cleaned out the modal code and the javascript link in question within the html files.

But on sort a hopeful note, I left the unused javascript files in the js folder, and I left the substantial uninvoked modal code in the style.css file.  Artifacts that are causing no harm at present, which I hope to use at some point in the future (when the class covers javascript).
